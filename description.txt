    @brief Basic application that presents the lwIP usage with S32K3 RTD

    ## Application description ##
    _____
    The purpose of this demo is to provide the user with an out-of-the box
    example application for S32K344 platform, using S32 RTD.
    The demo uses lwIP stack and supports more scenarios, which can be enabled
    or disabled on <b>Applications</b>, by modifying the \b lwipcfg.h file located in \b generate\include\.

    Basic functionality can be checked by pinging the board from the host PC:
        ping 192.168.0.200

    Please note that a prior setting of the IP on your PC might be needed. On Windows, this can be done from:

    <b>Control Panel</b> > <b>Network and Internet</b> > <b>Network and Sharing Center</b> > <b>Change adapter settings</b> > <b>Network adapter that connects to the board</b>

    Select <b>Internet Protocol Version 4</b> and click <b>Properties</b>; select <b>Use the following IP address</b> and configure the IP address and subnet mask.
    Configuration example: IP - 192.168.0.10, subnet mask - 255.255.255.0.

    For more information about supported application, you can see the "TCPIP_USER_MANUAL.pdf" that is contained by this package, located on "S32DS/software/PlatformSDK_S32K3/stacks/tcpip/doc".

    ## How to run ##
    _____
    #### 1. Importing the project into the workspace ####
    After opening S32 Design Studio, go to \b File -> \b New \b S32DS \b Project \b From... and select \b lwip_baremetal_s32k344. Then click on \b Finish. \n
    The project should now be copied into you current workspace.
    #### 2. Generating the Processor Expert configuration ####
    First go to \b Project \b Explorer View in S32 DS and select the current project(\b lwip_baremetal_s32k344). Then go to \b Project and click on \b Generate \b Processor \b Expert \b Code \n
    Wait for the code generation to be completed before continuing to the next step.
    #### 3. Building the project ####
    Select the configuration to be built \b Flash (Debug_Flash) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the \b build button(@image hammer.png).
    Wait for the build action to be completed before continuing to the next step.
    #### 4. Running the project ####
    Go to \b Run and select \b Debug \b Configurations. There will be a debug configuration for this project:
     Configuration Name | Description
     -------------------|------------
     \b lwip_baremetal_s32k344_debug_flash_pemicro | Debug the Flash configuration using PEMicro debuggers

     - Click Debug button at the Debug Configuration dialog. Now the perspective will change to the \b Debug \b Perspective. \n
     - Use the controls to control the program flow.

    #### 5. Expected results ####

    After executing "ping 192.168.0.200" cmd, command windows will display :
        Pinging 192.168.0.200 with 32 bytes of data:
        Reply from 192.168.0.200: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=255
