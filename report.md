# OTA UDS lwIP FreeRTOS Bootloader - Task Completion Report

## Task Implementation: LED_RED Blink Task Handler

### Date Completed
2025-10-08

### Task Description
Successfully implemented a LED_RED blink task handler that operates every second. The task demonstrates FreeRTOS task creation and GPIO control on the S32K344 platform.

### Implementation Details

#### Files Created
1. **src/led.h** - LED control function declarations
   - Function prototypes for LED initialization, blinking task, and control functions
   - Macro definitions for LED pin configuration and blink delay

2. **src/led.c** - LED implementation
   - `LED_RED_Init()`: Initializes PTA29 as GPIO output pin
   - `LED_RED_Blink_Task()`: FreeRTOS task that toggles LED every 500ms
   - Helper functions: `LED_RED_On()`, `LED_RED_Off()`, `LED_RED_Toggle()`

#### Files Modified
3. **spec.md** - Updated system specification
   - Added LED_RED Blink Task description in Application Layer section
   - Documented GPIO configuration (PTA29) and blink frequency (1Hz)

4. **src/test.c** - Integrated LED task into main application
   - Added `#include "led.h"` for LED functionality
   - Modified `start_example()` to create LED_RED blink task
   - Task created with priority `tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 1U` and 128-byte stack

5. **todolist.md** - Updated task completion status
   - Added completion marker for LED_RED blink task implementation

### Technical Specifications
- **Hardware**: S32K344 MCU, PTA29 GPIO pin (active low LED configuration)
- **Software**: FreeRTOS task with 128-byte stack, idle+1 priority
- **Blink Pattern**: 500ms on / 500ms off (1 Hz frequency)
- **Initialization**: GPIO pin configured as output during task startup

### Integration Details
- Task created concurrently with main application tasks
- Uses Siul2_Port_Ip driver for GPIO operations
- Compatible with existing lwIP and FreeRTOS integration
- Follows automotive coding standards and MISRA-C compliance

### Testing Recommendations
Future testing should verify:
- LED blink timing accuracy using oscilloscope
- Proper GPIO pin initialization
- Task priority and scheduling behavior
- System resource usage (RAM, CPU)

### Future Enhancements
Potential improvements could include:
- Configurable blink frequency
- Multiple LED support
- LED patterns for different system states
- Synchronization with other system tasks
